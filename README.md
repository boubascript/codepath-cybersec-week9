# Project 9: Honeypot
--------------------

Used Google Cloud Platform to host VM's that deployed low-interaction honeypots through Modern Honey Network.

Deployed a Dionaea over HTTP honeypot, and recieved **787** attacks. Almost all of the attacks were from IP's in the US and with pcap protocol, however a few were from other various countries, with protocols like httpd and mysqld.

To Learn:
- [ ] how to view malware samples that are captured 
- [ ] what the protocols in each attack mean

### Issues  
Many issues involved simply setting up a google cloud platform account, but besides that there were issues with learning how to use each VM to download the honeypots at first.
